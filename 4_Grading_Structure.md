## Grading Structure

Grades are not given but earned. Your grade is determined by your performance on the learning  assessments in the course and is assigned individually (and is not “curved”). If earning a particular  grade is important to you, please speak with me at the beginning of the semester so that I can offer  some helpful suggestions for achieving your goal.  

All weekly reading response scores will be posted on ELMS; all paper-based assignments will be returned with notes and grades. If you would like to review any of your grades (including the responses), or have questions about how something was scored, please see me after class or sign up for a virtual office hour slot.  

I am happy to discuss any of your grades with you, and if I have made a mistake, I will immediately correct it. Any formal grade disputes must be submitted in writing and within one week of receiving the grade.

### Some notes about some of the grading patterns I’m seeing:



* Weekly Reading Reflection is worth 6 points, responses to other people are worth 2 points, and each day late is -15%, which results in some wonky numbers - so thought I’d put them here:
    * Submitted on time but with no response to other people’s posts: 6 pts
    * Submitted on time, with a late response to other people: 7.7 pts
    * Submitted a day late with a response to other people: 7.4 pts
    * Submitted two days late with a response to other people: 6.8 pts
    * Submitted during class: 0 points 


### Final letter grades are assigned based on the percentage of total assessment points earned. To be fair to everyone, I establish clear standards and apply them consistently. Please understand that being _close_ to a cutoff is not the same as making the cut (89.99 ≠ 90.00). It would be unethical and inequitable to make exceptions for some and not others.
