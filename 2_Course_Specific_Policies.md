## Course-Specific Policies and Expectations for Students


### Course Structure

This is a ‚Äòflipped‚Äô classroom course - so you‚Äôll be reading chapters/articles, watching videos/lectures, and doing individual work outside of class. You are expected to complete the videos, readings, and assignments any time before class - use this flexibility to your advantage, so it works for your schedule! There _is _a deadline for the weekly reading responses, however: you have until midnight before class each week. 

**Attendance & Participation**

Our in-person class time will be used for discussions and collaborative work. I will be checking attendance and tracking participation during each class. If you need to miss the discussion due to an illness or similar reason, please contact me as soon as possible! 

**The ‚ÄòBlended‚Äô Experience!**

Having classes that are built across multiple modalities can be wonderful _and_ complicated! So here are some notes about the way that we‚Äôll be navigating the blended nature of this experience.

First, both sections will be sharing the same ELMS course space, so deadlines will be listed relationally - e.g., ‚Äúbefore class‚Äù or ‚Äúthe day before class‚Äù. Announcements or notes may be directed specifically to one section or the other - if a section isn‚Äôt explicitly mentioned, that means it‚Äôs for both! You are expected to track what is due when for your section, and submit on time.

Second, there will be a blend of online and offline assignments - for example, the weekly reading responses will be online via ELMS, but other projects and assignments must be printed out and handed in at the start of class. In addition, ELMS assignments may not include _all_ the details for the assignment - instead, details will be discussed in class, so keep good notes! 

To facilitate good notes, you all have the ability to create and edit files in our [shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1qUsbCn4dZucDsmubOL8XwIjucHlpwvJq), where this syllabus also lives! (If your umd.edu email doesn‚Äôt seem to have access, let me know!)


### Academic Integrity

To provide the most flexibility for all students, this introductory course will only include individual work. While group work is included in many graduate-level courses, there will not be any graded group work in this class (only group activities in-person). It is important that, as a foundational course, each student must master the skills individually. Please note that all work submitted by the individual student must be their own work product. Please consult the University of Maryland policy on academic integrity (the following section is verbatim from the University of Maryland policy on academic integrity).

_Any of the following acts, when committed by a student, shall constitute academic dishonesty:_



* _Cheating: fraud, deceit, or dishonesty in any academic course or exercise in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage and/or using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic course or exercise._
* _Fabrication: unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in any academic course or exercise._
* _Facilitating Academic Dishonesty: knowingly helping or attempting to help another to violate any provision of this Code._
* _Plagiarism: representing the words or ideas of another as one's own in any academic course or exercise._
* _Self-Plagiarism: the reuse of substantial identical or nearly identical portions of one's own work in multiple courses without prior permission from the current instructor or from each of the instructors if the work is being submitted for multiple courses in the same semester._
* _Students who are found to have falsified, fabricated, or plagiarized in any context, such as course work, laboratory research, archival research, or thesis / dissertation writing--will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct._


### Overall Workload Expectations

Sometimes students wonder how much work, how many hours are expected of them each week outside of meeting in ‚Äúthe classroom.‚Äù A graduate program involves  much more time than an undergraduate program, and I expect, _at minimum_, the following preparation time per week:  



* 3-4 hours doing the assigned reading  
* 2-3 hours watching the lecture video and any additional video  
* 1 hour on the reading response  
* 2-5 hours on assignments (you will need more time closer to assignment deadlines)  


### Late Assignments

The reading responses must be completed on ELMS by midnight the day before class, while the other assignments must be turned in at the beginning of class in paper form. The _only_ exception is the final deliverable, due during the exam period - this can be submitted via ELMS instead of via paper. 

The general policy in this class is that late assignments will be deducted by 15% of its possible points, with an  additional 15% of its points each day afterwards. Late assignments will be accepted according to this policy up to three days after the assignment due date (so, 3 days late = a maximum potential score of  55%). Assignments more than three days late will not be accepted. It is at the instructor‚Äôs discretion to  accept late work and assign late point deduction.  


### Extra Credit Work

Sometimes, extra credit assignments may pop up on ELMS or in class, if I deem it necessary or useful to the class. However, extra credit work will _not_ be given on an individual basis (e.g., don‚Äôt bother asking for additional extra credit because you want to raise your final grade). 


### Course Communication

I will send time-sensitive messages via ELMS announcements. You must make sure that your email & announcement notifications are enabled in ELMS so you do not miss any messages.

If you have questions about the course/etc., I strongly prefer that we conduct discussions synchronously - ideally in person during class or during office hours. _Please take advantage of our in-person class time to ask questions - if you‚Äôre wondering about something, chances are someone else is too! _ 

If you urgently need to reach out to me and class/office hours aren‚Äôt happening soon, then email me at [carowp@umd.edu](mailto:carowp@umd.edu) with ‚Äòurgent‚Äô in the title.

Please DO NOT email or message me with questions that are easily found in the syllabus or the crowdsourced class notes (i.e. When is this assignment due? How much is it worth? etc.).  

I highly recommend that you review this [brief post about writing professional emails](http://umdpsyc.blogspot.com/2012/03/what-your-write-matters-advise-on.html) - especially if most of your email experience is with friends, families, and school. This is part of your professional training, so that you are prepared to communicate successfully in the workplace - it‚Äôs an old post, but still very accurate üôÇ


### Getting Support!

You are expected to take personal responsibility for your own learning. This includes acknowledging when your performance does not match your goals and  doing something about it. Everyone can benefit from some expert guidance on time  management, note taking, and exam preparation. I encourage you to consider visiting [https://tltc.umd.edu/learning-assistance](https://tltc.umd.edu/learning-assistance)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>to schedule an appointment with an academic coach. Sharpen your communication skills (and improve your grade) by visiting [https://gradschool.umd.edu/graduate-school-writing-center](https://gradschool.umd.edu/graduate-school-writing-center)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>and schedule an appointment with the Graduate School Writing  Center. Finally, if ever you need someone to talk to, visit [http://www.counseling.umd.edu](http://www.counseling.umd.edu)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>to speak  with a counselor.  

_All of these services are free because you have already paid for it, and everyone needs help‚Ä¶ you just gotta ask!_


### Names/Pronouns and Self-Identifications:

The University of Maryland recognizes the importance of a diverse student body, and we are committed to fostering inclusive and equitable classroom environments. I invite you, if you wish, to tell us how you want to be referred to in this class, both in terms of your name and your pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them, etc.). Keep in mind that the pronouns someone uses are not necessarily indicative of their gender identity. Visit [trans.umd.edu](http://trans.umd.edu/) to learn more.

 Additionally, it is your choice whether to disclose how you identify in terms of your gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and dis/ability, among all aspects of your identity (e.g., should it come up in classroom conversation about our experiences and perspectives) and should be self-identified, not presumed or imposed.  I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly, and I ask you to do the same for all of your fellow Terps.


### Communication with Peers:

With a diversity of perspectives and experience, we may find ourselves in disagreement and/or debate with one another. As such, it is important that we agree to conduct ourselves in a professional manner and that we work together to foster and preserve a virtual classroom environment in which we can respectfully discuss and deliberate controversial questions. I encourage you to confidently exercise your right to free speech‚Äîbearing in mind, of course, that you will be expected to craft and defend arguments that support your position. Keep in mind, that free speech has its limit and this course is NOT the space for hate speech, harassment, and derogatory language. I will make every reasonable attempt to create an atmosphere in which each student feels comfortable voicing their argument without fear of being personally attacked, mocked, demeaned, or devalued.

Any behavior (including harassment, sexual harassment, and racially and/or culturally derogatory language) that threatens this atmosphere will not be tolerated. Please alert me immediately if you feel threatened, dismissed, or silenced at any point during our semester together and/or if your engagement in discussion has been in some way hindered by the learning environment.
