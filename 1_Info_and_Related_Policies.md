2. Identify strengths and weaknesses of various methods for user-based evaluation, expert-based evaluation, and automated evaluations, and identify inherent challenges and trade-offs in HCI
3. Design and implement basic usability testing and perform accessibility inspections of web sites
4. Identify and critically engage with the research literature in human-computer interaction
5. Approach HCI issues through an equity, inclusion, and social justice lens, and identify which laws, regulations, and policies address HCI-related work
