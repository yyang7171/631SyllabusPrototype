## Resources & Accommodations  


### Accessibility and Disability Services 

The University of Maryland is committed to creating and maintaining a welcoming and inclusive educational, working, and living environment for people of all abilities. The University of Maryland is also committed to the principle that no qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of the University, or be subjected to discrimination. The **[Accessibility & Disability Service (ADS)](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/ads/)** provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals to provide equal access to services, programs and activities. ADS cannot assist retroactively, so it is generally best to request accommodations several weeks before the semester begins or as soon as a disability becomes known. Any student who needs accommodations should contact me as soon as possible so that I have sufficient time to make arrangements.

For assistance in obtaining an accommodation, contact Accessibility and Disability Service at 301-314-7682, or email them at **[adsfrontdesk@umd.edu](mailto:adsfrontdesk@umd.edu)**. Information about **[sharing your accommodations with instructors, note taking assistance](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/ads/currentads/)** and more is available from the **[Counseling Center](http://counseling.umd.edu/ads/)**.


### Student Resources and Services

Taking personal responsibility for your own learning means acknowledging when your performance does not match your goals and doing something about it.  I hope you will come talk to me so that I can help you find the right approach to success in this course.

In particular, everyone can use some help sharpening their communication skills (and improving their grade) by visiting **UMD’s [Graduate Writing Center](https://gradschool.umd.edu/graduate-school-writing-center)** and schedule an appointment with the campus Writing Center. 

You should also know there are a wide range of resources to support you with whatever you might need (**[UMD’s Student Resources and Services website](https://sph.umd.edu/content/student-resources-and-services)** may help). If you feel it would be helpful to have someone to talk to, visit **[UMD’s Counseling Center ](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/)**or **[one of the many other mental health resources on campus](https://tltc.umd.edu/instructors/teaching-topics/supporting-whole-student)**.

**Notice of Mandatory Reporting**

Notice of mandatory reporting of sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, and stalking:  As a faculty member, I am designated as a “Responsible University Employee,” and I must report all disclosures of sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, and stalking to UMD’s Title IX Coordinator per University Policy on Sexual Harassment and Other Sexual Misconduct.

If you wish to speak with someone confidentially, please contact one of UMD’s confidential resources, such as [CARE to Stop Violence ](https://health.umd.edu/CARE) (located on the Ground Floor of the Health Center) at 301-741-3442 or the [Counseling Center](https://counseling.umd.edu) (located at the Shoemaker Building) at 301-314-7651.

You may also seek assistance or supportive measures from UMD’s Title IX Coordinator, Angela Nastase, by calling 301-405-1142, or emailing titleIXcoordinator@umd.edu.

To view further information on the above, please visit the [Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct's ](https://ocrsm.umd.edu/)website at [ocrsm.umd.edu](http://ocrsm.umd.edu/)**.**


### Basic Needs Security

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or lack a safe and stable place to live, please visit **[UMD’s Division of Student Affairs website](https://studentaffairs.umd.edu/basic-needs-security)** for information about resources the campus offers you and let me know if I can help in any way.


### Veteran Resources

UMD provides some additional supports to our student veterans. You can access those resources at the office of [Veteran Student life](https://stamp.umd.edu/engagement/veteran_student_life) and the [Counseling Center](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/aboutus/). Veterans and active duty military personnel with special circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill requirements, disabilities) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to the instructor.


### Course Evaluation 

Please submit a course evaluation through Student Feedback on Course Experiences in order to help faculty and administrators improve teaching and learning at Maryland. All information submitted to Course Experiences is confidential. Campus will notify you when Student Feedback on Course Experiences is open for you to complete your evaluations at the end of the semester. Please go directly to the **[Student Feedback on Course Experiences](http://courseexp.umd.edu/)** to complete your evaluations. By completing all of your evaluations each semester, you will have the privilege of accessing through Testudo the evaluation reports for the thousands of courses for which 70% or more students submitted their evaluations.
