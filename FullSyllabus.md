Please see the University's website for graduate course-related policies at: [https://gradschool.umd.edu/course-related-policies](https://gradschool.umd.edu/course-related-policies)

 


## Course-Specific Policies and Expectations for Students


### Course Structure

This is a ‘flipped’ classroom course - so you’ll be reading chapters/articles, watching videos/lectures, and doing individual work outside of class. You are expected to complete the videos, readings, and assignments any time before class - use this flexibility to your advantage, so it works for your schedule! There _is _a deadline for the weekly reading responses, however: you have until midnight before class each week. 

**Attendance & Participation**

Our in-person class time will be used for discussions and collaborative work. I will be checking attendance and tracking participation during each class. If you need to miss the discussion due to an illness or similar reason, please contact me as soon as possible! 

**The ‘Blended’ Experience!**

Having classes that are built across multiple modalities can be wonderful _and_ complicated! So here are some notes about the way that we’ll be navigating the blended nature of this experience.

First, both sections will be sharing the same ELMS course space, so deadlines will be listed relationally - e.g., “before class” or “the day before class”. Announcements or notes may be directed specifically to one section or the other - if a section isn’t explicitly mentioned, that means it’s for both! You are expected to track what is due when for your section, and submit on time.

Second, there will be a blend of online and offline assignments - for example, the weekly reading responses will be online via ELMS, but other projects and assignments must be printed out and handed in at the start of class. In addition, ELMS assignments may not include _all_ the details for the assignment - instead, details will be discussed in class, so keep good notes! 

To facilitate good notes, you all have the ability to create and edit files in our [shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1qUsbCn4dZucDsmubOL8XwIjucHlpwvJq), where this syllabus also lives! (If your umd.edu email doesn’t seem to have access, let me know!)


### Academic Integrity

To provide the most flexibility for all students, this introductory course will only include individual work. While group work is included in many graduate-level courses, there will not be any graded group work in this class (only group activities in-person). It is important that, as a foundational course, each student must master the skills individually. Please note that all work submitted by the individual student must be their own work product. Please consult the University of Maryland policy on academic integrity (the following section is verbatim from the University of Maryland policy on academic integrity).

_Any of the following acts, when committed by a student, shall constitute academic dishonesty:_



* _Cheating: fraud, deceit, or dishonesty in any academic course or exercise in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage and/or using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic course or exercise._
* _Fabrication: unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in any academic course or exercise._
* _Facilitating Academic Dishonesty: knowingly helping or attempting to help another to violate any provision of this Code._
* _Plagiarism: representing the words or ideas of another as one's own in any academic course or exercise._
* _Self-Plagiarism: the reuse of substantial identical or nearly identical portions of one's own work in multiple courses without prior permission from the current instructor or from each of the instructors if the work is being submitted for multiple courses in the same semester._
* _Students who are found to have falsified, fabricated, or plagiarized in any context, such as course work, laboratory research, archival research, or thesis / dissertation writing--will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct._


### Overall Workload Expectations

Sometimes students wonder how much work, how many hours are expected of them each week outside of meeting in “the classroom.” A graduate program involves  much more time than an undergraduate program, and I expect, _at minimum_, the following preparation time per week:  



* 3-4 hours doing the assigned reading  
* 2-3 hours watching the lecture video and any additional video  
* 1 hour on the reading response  
* 2-5 hours on assignments (you will need more time closer to assignment deadlines)  


### Late Assignments

The reading responses must be completed on ELMS by midnight the day before class, while the other assignments must be turned in at the beginning of class in paper form. The _only_ exception is the final deliverable, due during the exam period - this can be submitted via ELMS instead of via paper. 

The general policy in this class is that late assignments will be deducted by 15% of its possible points, with an  additional 15% of its points each day afterwards. Late assignments will be accepted according to this policy up to three days after the assignment due date (so, 3 days late = a maximum potential score of  55%). Assignments more than three days late will not be accepted. It is at the instructor’s discretion to  accept late work and assign late point deduction.  


### Extra Credit Work

Sometimes, extra credit assignments may pop up on ELMS or in class, if I deem it necessary or useful to the class. However, extra credit work will _not_ be given on an individual basis (e.g., don’t bother asking for additional extra credit because you want to raise your final grade). 


### Course Communication

I will send time-sensitive messages via ELMS announcements. You must make sure that your email & announcement notifications are enabled in ELMS so you do not miss any messages.

If you have questions about the course/etc., I strongly prefer that we conduct discussions synchronously - ideally in person during class or during office hours. _Please take advantage of our in-person class time to ask questions - if you’re wondering about something, chances are someone else is too! _ 

If you urgently need to reach out to me and class/office hours aren’t happening soon, then email me at [carowp@umd.edu](mailto:carowp@umd.edu) with ‘urgent’ in the title.

Please DO NOT email or message me with questions that are easily found in the syllabus or the crowdsourced class notes (i.e. When is this assignment due? How much is it worth? etc.).  

I highly recommend that you review this [brief post about writing professional emails](http://umdpsyc.blogspot.com/2012/03/what-your-write-matters-advise-on.html) - especially if most of your email experience is with friends, families, and school. This is part of your professional training, so that you are prepared to communicate successfully in the workplace - it’s an old post, but still very accurate 🙂


### Getting Support!

You are expected to take personal responsibility for your own learning. This includes acknowledging when your performance does not match your goals and  doing something about it. Everyone can benefit from some expert guidance on time  management, note taking, and exam preparation. I encourage you to consider visiting [https://tltc.umd.edu/learning-assistance](https://tltc.umd.edu/learning-assistance)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>to schedule an appointment with an academic coach. Sharpen your communication skills (and improve your grade) by visiting [https://gradschool.umd.edu/graduate-school-writing-center](https://gradschool.umd.edu/graduate-school-writing-center)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>and schedule an appointment with the Graduate School Writing  Center. Finally, if ever you need someone to talk to, visit [http://www.counseling.umd.edu](http://www.counseling.umd.edu)<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span>to speak  with a counselor.  

_All of these services are free because you have already paid for it, and everyone needs help… you just gotta ask!  _


### Names/Pronouns and Self-Identifications:

The University of Maryland recognizes the importance of a diverse student body, and we are committed to fostering inclusive and equitable classroom environments. I invite you, if you wish, to tell us how you want to be referred to in this class, both in terms of your name and your pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them, etc.). Keep in mind that the pronouns someone uses are not necessarily indicative of their gender identity. Visit [trans.umd.edu](http://trans.umd.edu/) to learn more.

 Additionally, it is your choice whether to disclose how you identify in terms of your gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and dis/ability, among all aspects of your identity (e.g., should it come up in classroom conversation about our experiences and perspectives) and should be self-identified, not presumed or imposed.  I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly, and I ask you to do the same for all of your fellow Terps.


### Communication with Peers:

With a diversity of perspectives and experience, we may find ourselves in disagreement and/or debate with one another. As such, it is important that we agree to conduct ourselves in a professional manner and that we work together to foster and preserve a virtual classroom environment in which we can respectfully discuss and deliberate controversial questions. I encourage you to confidently exercise your right to free speech—bearing in mind, of course, that you will be expected to craft and defend arguments that support your position. Keep in mind, that free speech has its limit and this course is NOT the space for hate speech, harassment, and derogatory language. I will make every reasonable attempt to create an atmosphere in which each student feels comfortable voicing their argument without fear of being personally attacked, mocked, demeaned, or devalued.

Any behavior (including harassment, sexual harassment, and racially and/or culturally derogatory language) that threatens this atmosphere will not be tolerated. Please alert me immediately if you feel threatened, dismissed, or silenced at any point during our semester together and/or if your engagement in discussion has been in some way hindered by the learning environment.


## Assignments and Projects

There will be no exams in this class. There will be four assignments spread across the semester: 



1. _Reading responses (due every week): _every week during the semester, there will be a reading response, designed to help you reflect on the readings and videos. We also recognize that adjusting to a new academic program can be  stressful. To ease some of your stress, _we will drop the response with the lowest grade_ at the end of the semester. Meaning that 11 of the 12 reading responses will count towards your final grade. 
2. _CHI paper review: _students are expected to choose two full-length (10+ pages) research  papers from the CHI 2022 or CHI 2023 conference. The two papers should be on a similar  topic (e.g., do not choose one paper on olfactory devices and another paper on visualization).  You should read the two papers and write up a three-page comparison of the papers in terms  of: 1) methodology, 2) results, and 3) writing style of the authors. You should also write about  4) your perceptions of the topic, and 5) what you think the next steps in future research on this  topic should be (your opinion, not the opinions of the paper authors). This assignment is due~~ in paper form at~~ to be submitted via [this form](https://forms.gle/xtqzg7vPQ6w6PT6d8) before class during Week 5. A template for the assignment is available in our shared Drive, as well as two examples of very well done papers from previous years.  You can access CHI papers through the ACM Digital Library ([https://dl.acm.org/](https://dl.acm.org/)). UMD has a  full license to use the ACM digital library, so if you are not on a campus IP address, you would  just need to login first at [https://www.lib.umd.edu/](https://www.lib.umd.edu/). As the first assignment of the semester, I  will grade this assignment more leniently than the others. I also strongly suggest contacting the (free!) Writing Center at [https://gradschool.umd.edu/graduate-school-writing-center](https://gradschool.umd.edu/graduate-school-writing-center) to get professional writing guidance - they are an amazing resource that can help you become a better writer, so take advantage! 
3. _Usability Evaluation: _You will be asked to do two forms of usability evaluation: 1) doing a usability test involving 5 users (any 5 users) attempting tasks remotely using remote usability testing software, and 2) an expert review on the same interface utilizing a set of heuristics (e.g.  Shneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design). You will need to report on the results of  each. The assignment is split into two separate deliverables on two separate dates. Templates for both assignments are available in our shared Drive. The expert review/heuristic review is due Week 9 online before class ~~ in paper form at class~~, and the usability testing deliverable is due online before class ~~ in paper form at class~~.
4. _Accessibility Testing: _You will be asked to do two forms of accessibility evaluation: 1) doing a  manual (expert) inspection of a web page utilizing the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  (WCAG, which we will discuss in class), and 2) inspecting the same web page using an  automated accessibility testing tool. We will provide access to the automated accessibility  testing tool, free of charge. You will need to report on the results of each. Again, the assignment is split into two separate deliverables on two separate dates. Templates for both  assignments are available in our shared Drive. The manual inspection is due at class in paper form in Week 14,  and the usability testing deliverable is due online on December 15th by 11:59 pm.


## Grading Structure

Grades are not given but earned. Your grade is determined by your performance on the learning  assessments in the course and is assigned individually (and is not “curved”). If earning a particular  grade is important to you, please speak with me at the beginning of the semester so that I can offer  some helpful suggestions for achieving your goal.  

All weekly reading response scores will be posted on ELMS; all paper-based assignments will be returned with notes and grades. If you would like to review any of your grades (including the responses), or have questions about how something was scored, please see me after class or sign up for a virtual office hour slot.  

I am happy to discuss any of your grades with you, and if I have made a mistake, I will immediately correct it. Any formal grade disputes must be submitted in writing and within one week of receiving the grade.

### Some notes about some of the grading patterns I’m seeing:



* Weekly Reading Reflection is worth 6 points, responses to other people are worth 2 points, and each day late is -15%, which results in some wonky numbers - so thought I’d put them here:
    * Submitted on time but with no response to other people’s posts: 6 pts
    * Submitted on time, with a late response to other people: 7.7 pts
    * Submitted a day late with a response to other people: 7.4 pts
    * Submitted two days late with a response to other people: 6.8 pts
    * Submitted during class: 0 points 


### Final letter grades are assigned based on the percentage of total assessment points earned. To be fair to everyone, I establish clear standards and apply them consistently. Please understand that being _close_ to a cutoff is not the same as making the cut (89.99 ≠ 90.00). It would be unethical and inequitable to make exceptions for some and not others.

## Resources & Accommodations  


### Accessibility and Disability Services 

The University of Maryland is committed to creating and maintaining a welcoming and inclusive educational, working, and living environment for people of all abilities. The University of Maryland is also committed to the principle that no qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of the University, or be subjected to discrimination. The **[Accessibility & Disability Service (ADS)](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/ads/)** provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals to provide equal access to services, programs and activities. ADS cannot assist retroactively, so it is generally best to request accommodations several weeks before the semester begins or as soon as a disability becomes known. Any student who needs accommodations should contact me as soon as possible so that I have sufficient time to make arrangements.

For assistance in obtaining an accommodation, contact Accessibility and Disability Service at 301-314-7682, or email them at **[adsfrontdesk@umd.edu](mailto:adsfrontdesk@umd.edu)**. Information about **[sharing your accommodations with instructors, note taking assistance](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/ads/currentads/)** and more is available from the **[Counseling Center](http://counseling.umd.edu/ads/)**.


### Student Resources and Services

Taking personal responsibility for your own learning means acknowledging when your performance does not match your goals and doing something about it.  I hope you will come talk to me so that I can help you find the right approach to success in this course.

In particular, everyone can use some help sharpening their communication skills (and improving their grade) by visiting **UMD’s [Graduate Writing Center](https://gradschool.umd.edu/graduate-school-writing-center)** and schedule an appointment with the campus Writing Center. 

You should also know there are a wide range of resources to support you with whatever you might need (**[UMD’s Student Resources and Services website](https://sph.umd.edu/content/student-resources-and-services)** may help). If you feel it would be helpful to have someone to talk to, visit **[UMD’s Counseling Center ](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/)**or **[one of the many other mental health resources on campus](https://tltc.umd.edu/instructors/teaching-topics/supporting-whole-student)**.

**Notice of Mandatory Reporting**

Notice of mandatory reporting of sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, and stalking:  As a faculty member, I am designated as a “Responsible University Employee,” and I must report all disclosures of sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, and stalking to UMD’s Title IX Coordinator per University Policy on Sexual Harassment and Other Sexual Misconduct.

If you wish to speak with someone confidentially, please contact one of UMD’s confidential resources, such as [CARE to Stop Violence ](https://health.umd.edu/CARE) (located on the Ground Floor of the Health Center) at 301-741-3442 or the [Counseling Center](https://counseling.umd.edu) (located at the Shoemaker Building) at 301-314-7651.

You may also seek assistance or supportive measures from UMD’s Title IX Coordinator, Angela Nastase, by calling 301-405-1142, or emailing titleIXcoordinator@umd.edu.

To view further information on the above, please visit the [Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct's ](https://ocrsm.umd.edu/)website at [ocrsm.umd.edu](http://ocrsm.umd.edu/)**.**


### Basic Needs Security

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or lack a safe and stable place to live, please visit **[UMD’s Division of Student Affairs website](https://studentaffairs.umd.edu/basic-needs-security)** for information about resources the campus offers you and let me know if I can help in any way.


### Veteran Resources

UMD provides some additional supports to our student veterans. You can access those resources at the office of [Veteran Student life](https://stamp.umd.edu/engagement/veteran_student_life) and the [Counseling Center](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/aboutus/). Veterans and active duty military personnel with special circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill requirements, disabilities) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to the instructor.


### Course Evaluation 

Please submit a course evaluation through Student Feedback on Course Experiences in order to help faculty and administrators improve teaching and learning at Maryland. All information submitted to Course Experiences is confidential. Campus will notify you when Student Feedback on Course Experiences is open for you to complete your evaluations at the end of the semester. Please go directly to the **[Student Feedback on Course Experiences](http://courseexp.umd.edu/)** to complete your evaluations. By completing all of your evaluations each semester, you will have the privilege of accessing through Testudo the evaluation reports for the thousands of courses for which 70% or more students submitted their evaluations.


### Thanks to…

Many thanks to Dr. Jonathan Lazar for the foundations of this syllabus and his incredible support!
