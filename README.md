# 631 Syllabus Prototype
This is a rough prototype of the INST631 syllabus as part of an assignment.

The content is broken up into sections according to the headings on the original syllabus. Short notes about version changes can be seen on the right of the file names. For more detailed information about updates/changes, click on the file, then click the commit comment or history button, and view the comments made on the commits. _[Not sure what a commit is?

Want to see older versions of the files? Click on the file and then the history button on top to see older versions!

_What's all the red and green highlights?_
Red indicates deletions and green indicates additions. Sometimes, large blocks of text can be highlighted in red if spacing is changed.
